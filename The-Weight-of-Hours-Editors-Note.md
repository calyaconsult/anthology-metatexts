## A Word on a Text with Unclear Provenance

['*The Weight of Hours*'](https://github.com/calyaconsult/anthology-ai-texts/blob/a0559ed5dd8cfc303b522c568adb8d4561a1827c/The-Weight-of-Hours-Chapter-3.md) is the odd piece in this collection. It was earmarked to go into the book "Unfinished Texts," which, up until today, hasn't left the concept stage. From the first time I read it, it hasn't lost its appeal—or should I say, its fascination. To me, it feels like real literature. I translated it into German, and it lost nothing of its literary quality. My companion, who read the German version, agreed with me: it really feels like something you'd read in a serious novel.

Its literariness was the reason I treated this text as a candidate for "Unfinished Texts." For that book, if it ever comes into being, provenance is of no importance. There are texts in that folder on my computer that have been generated by an LLM and left untouched; there are texts written entirely by me without being proofread or modified by an AI; and there are hybrid texts.

Thinking about what to include in the book, I copied the sample chapter and neglected to acknowledge its source. Now that I need to say where it comes from, all I can muster is: from a chatbot, most probably Claude. Despite the effort I invested in digging up the chat within which this text was generated, I can't find a trace of it.

All I can remember is that it started with the prompt:
```
I say:
- The past is dead.
- The past is alive.
- The past is a zombie.
What do you reply?
```
At some point during the chat, I remarked that this could be used as the seed for a novel. The chatbot eagerly suggested a three-part structure, and off we went. I'm including the result here, giving you my word that I haven't edited or altered it in any way. To me, it's a perfect example of what an LLM can write, and therefore deserves to be part of this anthology.
