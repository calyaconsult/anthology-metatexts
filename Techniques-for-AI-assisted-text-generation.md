# Techniques for AI-assisted Text Generation

### Phase 1: Model Setup & Constraints
*Techniques used to dictate how the AI "thinks" before the writing begins.*

*   **Fine-tuning:** Training a model on specific datasets (e.g., your own previous novels, a specific genre) to inherently adopt a certain style or format.
*   **Conditioning:** Setting overarching constraints and parameters (e.g., formatting rules, hard word limits, negative prompts to avoid certain tropes).
*   **Temperature:** Controlling the randomness of the output (Low = predictable and logical; High = creative, chaotic, and unexpected).
*   **Sampling Parameters:** Adjusting settings like Top-P, Top-K, and Presence/Frequency penalties to prevent the AI from repeating certain words, getting stuck in loops, or using overly flowery, cliché language.
*   **System Prompting / Persona Adoption:** Giving the AI a foundational identity at the system level (e.g., *"You are a grimdark fantasy author who writes in terse, punchy prose."*).

### Phase 2: Foundation & Context Management
*Techniques used to establish the world, characters, and starting point.*

*   **Seeding:** Providing a starting foundation, such as an opening paragraph, a piece of dialogue, or a story premise for the AI to launch from.
*   **Scaffolding / Outlining:** Using the AI to generate structural beats (Save the Cat, Hero's Journey) or chapter-by-chapter summaries *before* generating any actual prose.
*   **RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) / Lorebooks:** Hooking the AI up to a database or text file containing your worldbuilding rules, character sheets, and previous chapters so it can "remember" details it would otherwise forget due to context limits.

### Phase 3: Generation & Workflow
*Techniques used to actively draft the narrative.*

*   **Prompting:** Directing the AI with clear, specific instructions on what to write in the immediate generation.
*   **Chaining:** Building narrative in stages by passing the output of one prompt directly into the next (e.g., Prompt 1: Generate an outline -> Prompt 2: Expand point A into a scene -> Prompt 3: Add dialogue to the scene).
*   **Few-Shot Prompting:** Giving the AI 2 or 3 examples of the *exact prose style* you want inside the prompt so it can mimic the rhythm and vocabulary.
*   **Iterative Co-writing / Ping-Ponging:** A collaborative approach where the human writes a sentence or paragraph, the AI writes the next, the human edits and writes another, creating a seamless blend of human/AI text.

### Phase 4: Manipulation & Exploration
*Techniques used to alter, pivot, or explore alternative narratives.*

*   **Variation:** Exploring multiple versions of the same core idea (e.g., generating three different ways a character might react to a betrayal).
*   **Transposition:** Shifting a narrative to different contexts (e.g., rewriting a sci-fi scene as a western, or shifting the perspective from First Person to Third Person Limited).
*   **Style Transfer:** Taking an existing, flatly written scene and asking the AI to rewrite it in a specific tone (e.g., more melancholic, more urgent, in the style of Edgar Allan Poe).
*   **In-painting & Out-painting:** Selecting a specific sentence in the middle of a text to be rewritten by the AI without changing the surrounding text (In-painting), or asking the AI to expand the beginning or end of a scene outward (Out-painting).

### Phase 5: Refinement & Post-Processing
*Techniques used to polish the generated prose.*

*   **Filtering:** The human process of selecting the best outputs, curating the "golden threads" from a pile of generated text, and discarding the rest.
*   **AI Critique / Self-Correction:** Asking the AI to review its own generated text (or the user's text) to find plot holes, pacing issues, or repetitive sentence structures, and suggesting fixes.
*   **Distillation:** Asking the AI to take a rambling, overly long scene and cut it down to its most impactful, concise elements.
