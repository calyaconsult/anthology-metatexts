**Prompt** Grandfather: Rasmus has three sons: Jonathan, Randolph, Elias. Jonathan dies early; his father survives him. When the father dies his house goes to Randolph who is unmarried and without offspring. Elias has a son named Benjamin, Jonathan a son named Arthur. Randolph is the last of Rasnus's sons to die. In his will, he leaves the house he inherited to Arthur, the son of his older brother. Can you see the logic here or is there a flaw?

I can see the intended logic, and there’s a small but important flaw depending on the jurisdiction: whether Randolph could validly leave the house to Arthur in his will.

**What works:**
- Rasmus (the grandfather) has three sons: Jonathan (dies before Rasmus), Randolph, and Elias.
- When Rasmus dies, his house goes to Randolph. That’s fine if Rasmus’s will or the intestacy rules put the house to a surviving son; since Jonathan predeceased Rasmus, Jonathan wouldn’t take directly.
- Randolph is unmarried and has no children. He’s the last of the three brothers to die.

**The potential flaw:**
- If the house “goes to Randolph when the father dies” because of Rasmus’s will or intestacy, Randolph owns it outright in fee simple (assuming a typical modern regime).
- If Randolph owns it outright, he can leave it to whomever he wants by will, including Arthur (Jonathan’s son), unless there is some restriction (entailed estate, life estate, trust, or a survivorship/condition in Rasmus’s will).
- However, if instead Rasmus’s will stated something like “to my son Randolph for life, then to my issue per stirpes,” or “to my surviving sons, and if any predecease me, their issue take by representation,” then Randolph might only have had a life estate, or the house might have been subject to a substitutional gift or class gift that would pass to the issue of the predeceased son (Arthur or Benjamin) automatically on Randolph’s death—leaving Randolph with nothing to devise by will. In such a case, Randolph’s attempt to bequeath it to Arthur would be ineffective; the remainder would pass under Rasmus’s instrument or under intestacy rules, not Randolph’s will.

So:
- If Randolph truly inherited the house outright (fee simple absolute), there’s no flaw: Randolph can validly leave it to Arthur.
- If Randolph only had a life interest or the house was subject to a remainder or class gift under Rasmus’s estate plan, then Randolph could not redirect it by will, and the bequest to Arthur would be a flaw.

Given your phrasing—“When the father dies his house goes to Randolph” and later “In his will, he leaves the house he inherited to Arthur”—it reads like Randolph owned it outright. In that straightforward scenario, the logic is sound, and there’s no flaw.
